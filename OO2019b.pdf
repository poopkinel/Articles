Unbounded Human Wants Argument

Modern economic theory is based on the following argument:
1. Available resources are finite.
2(a). Human wants are infinite.
Therefore:
3. There will always be scarcity.
4. We need the best mechanism for allocating the scarce resources (i.e: money).

I argue that sentences number 2 is false, and in its places should be:
2(b). Human wants are unbounded from above.
And therefore: 
3. At each point in time where human wants exceed amount of resources, there is scarcity.
4. We need the best mechanism for finding substitutes for scares resources (i.e science and technology).
