We use the predefined R set and H set [TODO: add the definitions to former chapters]

let r1, r2 be members of R.
Define r1 (+) r2 to be the union of r1 and r2 (r1 and r2 are both sets for the same reason an apple consists of the stem, the seeds and the "flesh" of the apple).
let c be a real number,
We can see that c*(r1 + r2) = c*r1 + c*r2 (e.g: if you have 2 oranges, and I have 2 peaches, putting them together is the same as having an orange and a peach - twice.
Easy to see r1 (+) r2 = r2 (+) r1
We can define [a completely theoretical] /eta which is the "empty resource" -
  /eta + r = r ; for every r in R.
  
Define r1 (x) r2 to be the composition of r1 and r1 (e.g: r1 = 2 wheels, r2 = a bycicle shassy => r1 (x) r2 = a bycicle (the wheels connected to the shassy)

We have an Abelian Group, closed under (+), commutative (with multiplication) and a unit. Thus, a vector space.
